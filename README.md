# SDN-files
This file includes the SDN controller I worked on to meet a specific behavior like splitting network flow.

This whole project was from a course named "Data Center and Cloud Computing"/

Through all the labs with this course, I learned the concept of Software Defined Network and the skills of managing the SDN controller.

Even more, I learned how SDN controller will behave based on the what I programmed the SDN controller.

Dropbox Folder includes the lab reports to demonstrate what I implemented on SDN controller and the knowledge I have.
